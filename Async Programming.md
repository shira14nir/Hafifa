1. - **Async Programming**: Asynchronous programming allows a program to perform tasks concurrently, improving efficiency and responsiveness. It often involves non-blocking operations that enable a program to continue executing other tasks while waiting for resources or data.
    
2. **Thread**: A thread is a lightweight, smaller unit of a process that can run concurrently with other threads within the same process. Threads share the same memory space and resources, making them efficient for parallel tasks but also prone to issues like race conditions.
    
3. **Process**: A process is an independent program in execution with its own memory space and resources. Processes are isolated from each other, which prevents them from interfering directly with each otherâ€™s memory but adds overhead compared to threads.
    
4. **Coroutine**: A coroutine is a special type of function that can pause execution and yield control back to the event loop, allowing other tasks to run concurrently. Coroutines are essential for writing asynchronous code, particularly in Python with the `async` and `await` keywords.
    
5. **Async Function**: An async function is a function defined with the `async` keyword that returns an awaitable object, typically a coroutine. It allows for asynchronous operations and can contain `await` expressions to pause execution until a specified task completes.
    
6. **Await Keyword**: The `await` keyword is used inside an async function to pause its execution until the awaited coroutine or asynchronous operation completes. It ensures that the async function yields control back to the event loop, allowing other tasks to run concurrently.
    
7. **Asyncio**: `asyncio` is a Python library for writing concurrent code using the async/await syntax. It provides tools for managing event loops, coroutines, tasks, and other asynchronous operations, making it easier to write scalable and responsive applications.
    
8. **Event Loop**: An event loop is a core component of asynchronous programming that continuously checks for and dispatches events or tasks to be executed. It manages the scheduling and execution of asynchronous operations, ensuring that tasks run in a non-blocking manner.
